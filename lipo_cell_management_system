/*Outline of a script to measure and record the voltage of a 3.7 v 
 * lipo cell with a 3.3v microcontroller. 
 * 
 * Eventually will be used to manage the charging of the battery, 
 * and recording the value into a database
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *      >>> LiPo Cell Safety! <<<
 *      
 *      Vmax = 4.20 v
 *      Vmin = 3.00 v  (Maintain 3.2/3.3 for safety)
 *      
 *      
 *      Cell Capacity:
 *      1000 mAh             
 *      
 *      1000 mAh * 3.7 v (Nominal) = 3.7 Wh 
 *      
 *      
 *      Charging: *      
 *      
 *      C rating Note:
 *      As a general rule, you should charge your batteries a current of 1C. 
 *      So, for a 2200 mAh capacity battery, the charge rate should be 2.2 Amps 
 *      and for a 1700 mAh capacity battery, the charge rate should be 1.7 Amps
 *      
 *      Current Draw:
 *      3S 1000 mAh 20C LiPo pack, your safe max current draw would be 1000 mA x 20C = 20,000 mA or 20 A.
 *      1S 1000 mAh 15C                  -           -             -   1000 mA x 15C = 15,000 mA or 15 A
 *      
 *      
 *      So Current Draw for this Application:
 *      
 *      = X to be Measured
 *      
 *      at voltage 3.7 v
 *      
 *      X A * 3.7 v = 3.7X W
 *      
 *      = __________ h Operation time with no top up
 *      
 *
